# Cans Pick and Find Game

## What is this game?
This is a simple and fun memory matching game where you click on boxes to try and find matching pairs! The symbols are randomly placed in the boxes, and your goal is to find and match them by clicking around. When you find all the pairs, you win! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Play
1. Click on any box to reveal the hidden symbol.
2. Click on another box to try and find its matching pair.
3. If the symbols match, they stay revealed!
4. If they donâ€™t match, they will be hidden again.
5. Keep going until you match all the pairs.
6. Want to play again? Just hit the **New Game** button to reset everything.

## Whatâ€™s Under the Hood?
- **HTML**: Lays out the game board and buttons.
- **CSS**: Styles the boxes and makes things look nice.
- **JavaScript**: Controls the game logic, randomizing the symbol placements and handling user clicks.

## Future Improvements

- Add different difficulty levels with more symbols.
